# Machine Learning Projects Repository - README

## Overview

This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects aimed at solving different problems using various datasets and algorithms. The projects included are:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
2. **Customer Churn Prediction**
3. **Movie Genre Classification**

Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and conclusions.

### Project Descriptions

#### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

- **Dataset:** The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraud cases.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
  - Model Training: Using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - Evaluation: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

#### 2. Customer Churn Prediction

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service).

- **Dataset:** The dataset includes customer details for a telecommunications company.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing values.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigating customer demographics and behavior.
  - Model Training: Using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Evaluation: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

#### 3. Movie Genre Classification

**Objective:** Classify movies into different genres based on their plot summaries.

- **Dataset:** The dataset contains movie plots and their corresponding genres.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of genres.
  - Model Training: Using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks.
  - Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
