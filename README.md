# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects aimed at solving different problems using various datasets and algorithms. The projects included are:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
2. **Customer Churn Prediction**
3. **Movie Genre Classification**

Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and conclusions.

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects-repo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```
   cd ml-projects-repo
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install notebook`.)

4. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. **Open the desired project notebook and run the cells:**
   - `CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION.ipynb`
   - `CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION.ipynb`
   - `MOVIE_GENRE_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
